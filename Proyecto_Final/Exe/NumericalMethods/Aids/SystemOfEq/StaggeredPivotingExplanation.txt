SCALED PIVOTING

Also called staggered is the one in which in each step of the Gaussian elimination the
best pivot is selected among the candidates (those in the column), the one that is May
proportionally speaking with respect to the elements in its own row.
The largest number is found proportionally because it is known that all the equations are
not with the same units so they cannot be directly compared.
Steps to follow:
 The system of equations is written in a matrix form.
 The number of the column that is being evaluated is taken and divided by the
greater number of the same row.
 The largest number in absolute value of the column is selected according to the
proportion already made.
 The Gaussian elimination process is carried out.
 The process is repeated for the following columns until the system is finished.
