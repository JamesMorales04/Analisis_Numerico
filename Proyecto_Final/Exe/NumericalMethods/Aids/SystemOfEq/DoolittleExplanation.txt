The doolittle method is part of the matrix factorization methods family, what implies that this method consist in
finding two triangular matrices one whith its values above the diagonal (upper triangular matrix) which we will call U and
one with its values below the diagonal (Lower triangular matrix), the later receives the name L standing for "Lower". These
matrices allow us to create two system equations which will help us solve for the values of x of the original system.
   Ax=b
   A=LU

Every value in L's diagonal is a one.
   lij = 1    where i=j

Given that L's diagonal consist just of ones, by multiplying L's first row by U's first column we can solve for U's values
and L's values. To obtain both U's and L's values we apply the following procedures in n-1 phases being n the number of rows:

 1)Find the U row of the given phase (i=phase)
   uij = (Aij-sum(Lij*Uji))/Lij
 
 2)Find the L column of the given phase (i=phase)
    lij = (Aij-sum(Lij*Uji))/uij

 3)Repeat steps 1 and 2 until phase n-1.

 4)Use gaussian elimination in the extended matrix LB to find the values z, which will be used in the next step.
    Lz=b

 5)Use gaussian elimination in the extended matrix UZ to find the values x and solve the equation system.
    Ux=z
