How Quadratic Splines Words?

In this case, the polynomials P (x) through which we build the Spline have degree 2. This means that it will have the form P (x) = ax 2 + bx + c
As in linear segmental interpolation, we will have n-1 equations where n are the number of points on which the function is defined.
The quadratic interpolation will assure us that the function that we generate in pieces with the different P (x) will be continuous, since to calculate the coefficients that fit the polynomials to the points, we will determine as conditions:

Let the parts of the piecewise function P (x) pass through those points. That is, the two P_ {n} (x) that surround f (x) that we want to approximate, are equal to f (x) at each of these points.
That the derivative at one point always coincides for both "sides" of the piecewise defined function that passes through such common point.
This however is not enough, and we need one more condition. Why?. We have 3 unknowns for each P (x).
In a simple case with f (x) defined at three points and two equations P (x) to approximate it, we will have six unknowns in total. To solve this we would need six equations, but we will have only five:
four that equate P (x) with the value of f (x) at each point (two for each interval), and the fifth by equating the derivative at the point common to the two P (x).

A sixth equation is needed, where is it drawn from? This is usually done with the value of the derivative at some point, to which one of the P (x) is forced.
