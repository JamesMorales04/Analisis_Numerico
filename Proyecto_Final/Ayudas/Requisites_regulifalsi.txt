Prerequisites for regula falsi:
The parameters for this method are: 
-Requires an interval (a,b) in which a root exists (most likely calculated in an incremental search)
- The tolerance
- A quantity of iterations that indicates failure.
The idea of this method if finding the root of the interval (where f(x)=0). It does so validating first if the root is not on the edges because if so, the method ends. Also validates if there is a difference in the signs evaluated in the edges in order to make sure parameters are correct. 
First a midpoint (Xm) is calculated using a-[f(a)(a-b)/(f(b)-f(a))]. Then the function is evaluated in that midpoint and if f(Xm) = 0 or the relative error is less or equal to the tolerance, the method ends with success, else, the process is repeated as follows: 
Depending on the result of f(Xm) it replaces the left  part of the interval  or the right part:
When f(a)*f(Xm)>0 then a=Xm
When f(a)*f(Xm)<0 then b=Xm
when f(a)*f(Xm)=0 then the root is f(Xm).
In each iteration the error and the distance to the root will be less than the previous one, it uses a secant line that approaches the solution and always converges.
