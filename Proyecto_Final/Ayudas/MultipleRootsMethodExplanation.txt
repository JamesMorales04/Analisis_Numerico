Multiple Roots Method Explanation

This method is a variance of the fixed point method, which uses the given function and that 
need to use the first and second derivate to calculate the following value
and by doing so, aproximate or get the solution value (root value).

A principal difference between fixed point and secant is that you need multiples roots
where you are looking for.

Paramenters:
-Xn: starting value given by the user. (the chosen point in the interval can affect 
the number of iterations or the convergence of the method)
-Tolerance: threshold for the maximum acceptable error. Might be greater or equal to cero (tol>=0).
-Iterations: threshold for the maximum number of iterations. Can't be less that one (iter>=1).

When aplying this method, we first check whether derivates are tending to cero by calculating f'(xi) and f''(xu), 
check that the tolerance is greater or equal to cero, check that the iterations number is greater or
equal to one, in which case, we will end the process. Next we proceed to calculte the next xm:

Xm = x-((f(x)*f'(x))/((f'(x)^2)-f(x)*f''(x)))

The error with the following equation:

error = abs((X1-Xu)/X1)  Note: abs stands for absolute value.

Then, we increment the iteration counter and repeat this process until one of counter>iter,
error<=tol, F(Xm)=0 is met. Finally, we check which of the later conditions was met and return
it to the user.
