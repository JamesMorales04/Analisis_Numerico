
Fixed Point Method Procedure Explanation

This text explains to the user the implementation of the fixed point method, which by the end of this text the user should be in full understanding of the method implementation.

Method Goal:

This methods goal is to find one root (f(x)=0) of the function f(x) (which can have multiple roots) or one aproximation to it
by evaluating the the function g(x) (obtained by solving the f(x) equation for x in one possible form) in X0 and subsequenty
in X1, for a fixed number of iterations before the tolerance is met or the maximum number of iterations is surpassed.This may
converge to the desired root.

Inputs:

This method requires the following parameters defined by the user as imputs for its operation:

1) Xo : value which belongs to the domain of the function and from which the method will start its operation. 
        Note: Its recommended to select this value from a good range of values defined by the bisection method, incremental search method, etc.
2) Tolerance: value which defines the maximum error the user is willing to accept. This parameter might not be less than cero.
3) Iterations: value which defines the maximum number of iterations the method should take. This paramenter might not be less or equal to cero.

Method Procedure:

----------------------------------Input Validation Steps -------------------------------------------------------

1)Evaluate the function in the starting value (f(X0)) and assign it to Yo.
2)Check if Yo is cero, in which case Xo will be a root. If true, print "X0 is a root" and end the process. Otherwise, go to the next step.
2)Check if the given tolerance is less than cero. If true, print "The given tolerance is invalid" and end the process. Otherwise, go to the next step.
3)Check if the given number of iterations is less or equal to cero. If true, print "The given number of iterations is invalid" and end the process. Otherwise, go to the next step.

---------------------------------Calculation Process Steps-----------------------------------------------------

4)Assign to X1(variable) the value of X0.
5)Evaluate the funtion in X1 (f(X1)) and assign it to the Y1(variable).
6)Add the tolerance and 200(or any other big number), and assign the resulting value to error(variable).
7)Assign to counter(variable) the value of 1.
8)while Y1 is not cero, error is greater than tolerance and counter is less or equal iterations, do as follows:
  - Assign the value of Y1 to auxiliary(variable).
  - Evaluate the the function g(x) in X1 and assign its value to X1.
  - Evaluate the function f(x) in X1 and assign its value to Y1.
  - Calculete the error by taking the absolute value of subtracting Y1 and auxiliary, then assign it to error(variable).
  - Finally, add one to the counter variable.

9)Check if Y1 is equal to cero. If true, print X1 is a root and stop the process. Otherwise, go to the next step.
10)Check if error is less or equal to the tolerace. If so, print X1 is a root and end the process. Otherwise, print "failure in the iterations".
