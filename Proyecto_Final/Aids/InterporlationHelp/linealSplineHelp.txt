How Lienal Splines Words?

This is the simplest case. In it, we are going to interpolate a function f (x) of which we are given a number N of pairs (x, f (x)) through which our polynomial function P (x) will have to pass.
This series of functions of ours are going to be linear, that is, with degree 1: of the form P (x) = ax + b.
We will define one of these functions for each pair of adjacent points, up to a total of (N-1) functions,
making them pass necessarily through the points that are going to determine them, that is, the function P (x) will be the set of segments that join consecutive knots;
that is why our function will be continuous at these points, but not generally derivable.

Example: Interpolate with splines f (x) = 1 / x, at the points where x is equal to 1, 2 and 4

f (1) = 1
f (2) = 0.5
f (4) = 0.25
The first segment P {1} (x) = ax + b must join the first two coordinate points (1,1)} and (2,0.5).
A linear system of two equations emerges in two unknowns:

(1) 1 = a + b
(2) 0.5 = 2a + b
From (1) we obtain:
(3) a = 1-b
Substituting (3) in (2) we obtain:
0.5 = 2 (1-b) + b
then
b = 1.5
Replacing the value of (b) in (1), we obtain:
a = -0.5
Therefore, it is concluded that: P_ {1} (x) = - 0.5x + 1.5
The second segment P2 (x) = ax + b must join the second point (2,0.5) with the third point (4,0.25).
Analogously to what is done for P_ {1} (x), in the case of P_ {2} (x) we obtain:
(1) 0.5 = 2a + b
(2) 0.25 = 4a + b
a = -0.125, b = 0.75

Then P_ {2} (x) = - 0.125x + 0.75
