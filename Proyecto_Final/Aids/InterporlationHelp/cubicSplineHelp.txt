How Cubic Splines Words?

In this case, each polynomial P (x) through which we build the Splines have degree 3.
This means that it will have the form P (x) = ax ^ 3 + bx ^ 2 + cx + d
In this case we will have four unknowns for each interval (a, b, c, d), and a new condition for each point common to two intervals, with respect to the second derivative:

Let the parts of the piecewise function P (x) pass through that point. That is, the two P_ {n} (x) that surround the f (x) that we want to approximate, are equal to f (x) at each of these points.
That the derivative at one point always coincides for both "sides" of the piecewise defined function that passes through such common point.
That the second derivative at one point always coincides for both "sides" of the piecewise defined function that passes through such common point.
