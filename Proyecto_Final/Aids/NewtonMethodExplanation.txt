Newtons Method Explanation

Paramenters:
-X0: starting value given by the user. Should be in the functions domain.
-tol: threshold for the maximum acceptable error. Might be greater or equal to cero (tol>=0).
-iter: threshold for the maximum number of iterations. Can't be less tha one (iter>=1).

This method is a variance of the fixed point method, which uses the given function and its first derivative
to calcute the next value and by doing so, aproximate or get the solution value (root value).

When aplying this method, we first check whether X0 is the root by calculating Y0=F(X0), check that
the tolerance (tol) is greater or equal to cero (tol>=0), check that the iterations number is greater or
equal to one (iter>=1) and if the first derivative of the function is equal to cero (F'(X)=0), in which
case, we will end the process.Next, we proceed to calculte the next x axis value with the function:

Xi+1 = X0 - F(X0)/F'(X0)

The error with the following equation:

error = abs((Xi+1-X0)/Xi+1)  Note: abs stands for absolute value.

Then, we increment the iteration counter (counter+=1) and repeat this process until one of counter>iter,
error<=tol, F'(Xi+1)=0 or F(Xi+1)=0 is met. Finally, we check which of the later conditions was met and return
it to the user.
