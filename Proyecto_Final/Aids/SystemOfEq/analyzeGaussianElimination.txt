The algorithm consist in 2 phases: Elimination and substitution.

Elimination: Given the matrix Ab, we want to convert that matrix un a 
superior triangular matrix.
1.1. The objective is to replace with 0's the elements in the matrix that are below
abI1 with I= 2,3,....,n
We need to use multipliers, multipliers are calculated with:
m21 = a21/a11 
m31=a31/a11
m41= a41/a11 and so on.

Then the new rows of the Matrix are calculated with FI = FI - mI1*F1 with I = 2,...,n.
F2= F2-m21*F1
F3= F3-m31*F1
F4= F3-m41*F1 and so on.
This is for the first column.

1.2. The same process is repeated for the second column:
The objective is to replace with 0's the elements in the matrix that are below
abI2 with I= 3,4,...n
We need to use multipliers, multipliers are calculated with:
m21 = a22/a22 
m31=a32/a22
m41= a42/a22 and so on.
Then the new rows of the Matrix are calculated with FI = FI - mI2*F2 with I = 3,...,n.
F3= F3-m32*F2
F4= F4-m42*F2 and so on.
This is for the second column.

The process is repeated until we get the last element below abII to be replaced
with 0's in the Matrix

2. Substitution
Here we have to create an equation using the matrix 
For every column an Xi is asigned, with i = 1,2,...n
For every row an equation is made using the value of the column and row
multiplied by Xi
for example
X1   X2   X3  
3    2    1  40
0    5    6  30
0    0    3  40

The equations would be: 
3x1+2x2+x3 =40
5x2+6x3=40 
3x3= 40
And finally, having those equations the next step is to asolate the variables.
