This method consist of n-1 stages, where n is the number of rows of the given matrix. Each stage will consist of operations 
over the matrix with the aim to make the current matrix a triangular superior matrix and reduce the propagation error by placing
the greatest absolute value number of each column on the diagonal. To achive this goal, we use the following procedure for each stage:

1) Find the greatest absolute value on the current column, starting by number in the diagonal, up to the last number of the current
column. If the number is cero, then stop the process.

2)Places the found number on the diagonal by switching the corresponding matrix rows. Steps 1 and 2 can expressed in the following 
formula:
        aii = max{|aki|}                      Where i<=k<=n

3)Calculate the multipliers for each row by diving the each number below the diagonal on the current column by the number placed on
the diagonal. This operation is done as follows:
        Mi+1 = a(i+1)i/aii
        Mi+2 = a(i+2)i/aii
              .
              .
              .
        Mi+k = a(i+k)i/aii                    Where i is current row and column index, i+k<=n and Mi+k stands for each row multiplier 

4)Substract each row below the current one(stage row) by the product of the respective row multiplier and the current row (stage row).
This operation is done as follows:
        Fi+1 = Fi+1 - Mi+1*Fi
        Fi+1 = Fi+1 - Mi+1*Fi
                   .
                   .
                   .
        Fi+k = Fi+k - Mi+k*Fi                  Where i is the current row index, i+k<=n and Fi+k stands for each row.

5) Repeat steps 1,2,3 and 4 until stage n-1.

6)Calculate each variables value from the bottom to the top by solving each equation and replacing it in the one at the top.
