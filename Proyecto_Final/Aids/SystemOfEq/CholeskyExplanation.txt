if A is hermitian and positive definite, then A can be decomposed as 
A = LL*, where L is a lower triangular matrix with strictly positive diagonal inputs,
and L * representes the transposed conjugate L. This is Cholesky decomposition.

It is unique: given a defined positive Hermitian matrix A, there is
a single lower triangular matrix L with strictly positive diagonal entries
such that A= LL*. 

The requirement that L have strictly positive diagonal inputs can be extended in the case
of decomposition in the case of being positive semidefinite. The proposition is now
read: A square matrix A has a Cholesky decomposition if and only if A is Hermitian
and positive semidefinite. Cholesky factorizations for positive semi-defined matrices
are not unique overall.

In the special case that A is a symmetric defined positive matrix with real inputs, L can
also be assumed with real inputs. A diagonal D matrix with positive entries on the
diagonal (eigenvalues ​​of A), is factorizable as, D = root(D)*root(D) where root(D) is
 a matrix whose diagonal consists of the square root of each element of D, 
which we take as positive. So the factorization can be directly calculated by
the following formula:
Uii= aii - summatory ((from k=1 to i-1)) uik for the elements of the main diagonal.
And
Uik = (aij - summatory (k=1 to j-1) Uik*Ujk)/ Ujj
