Jacobi's method is an iterative method based on a fixed point, so the intention is to solve the
system of linear equations Ax = b from an initial vector x0 that serves as an approximation to the
solution vector x. Similarly, with x0 x1 is generated, with x1 x2 is generated, and so on in the form:
Xn + 1 = G (xn)
Thus, the approximate vector Xn + 1 is intended to converge to the solution of the system.
