Simple methods:
Using this methods we pretend to get a solution for a defined integral from a to b.

Trapezium
For accomplish the objective, we use Lagrange polinomial p1(x) = mx +b, this polinomial is defined
by the points (a,f(a)) and (b,f(b)), so that the area down the curve is approximated
by the line that connects the two points.


Simpson 1/3
We pretend to get the area down the curve using the Lagrange's quadratic polinomial.
So we use three points as a base for the interpolation. They are related 
with the limit of the interval and a medium point between them.
So x0= a,x2= b and x1 = (a+b)/2. This method is based on Taylor series. 


Simpson 3/8
We pretend to get the area down the curve using Lagrange's cubic polinomial.
So we choose 4 points equally distanced between as a base for the interpolation.
They are related with the start of the integral, the end and intermedium points between them.
The partition is defined in x0, x1,x2,x3 where x0=a, x1 = x0+(b-a)/3, x2 ) x0+2(b-a)/3 and x3=b.

Generalized methods:
They divide the interval of the integral in subintervals of equal distance between
all the points given.

Trapezium:
Using the same concept as trapezium, we divide the interval in subintervals of
equal distance (h) between them, so each interval contains h=(b-a)/n.
The idea is to distribute the integral in each of them and use trapezium to 
all of the points, so, the resultant expression should be an approximation to 
the integral.

Simpson 1/3:
We repeatedly use Simpson 1/3 method in the subintervals created, it is mandatory that n
is pair because it is evaluated in x0 and x2, x2 and x4 and so on...
It means that the integral is "distributed" for each interval to use Simpson 1/3 
for each on them and that is how we calculate the result.


Simpson 3/8:
We repeatedly use Simpson 3/8 method in the subintervals created, that means for each interval
an simpson 3/8 function is evaluated in order to get the integral.
